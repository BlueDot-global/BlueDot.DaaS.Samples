## Functionality

BlueDot’s example template for new, notable, and unusual activity enables users to stay informed of disease activities in locations of interest. With this template, users will easily understand activity that is new, notable, or unusual in locations of interest based on BlueDot’s reports of recent events. Users are able to filter BlueDot reports based on desired locations, diseases, time frame or report type (such as breaking news, new activity, or situational updates). Content for this template is generated by BlueDot’s intelligence platform, for use by BlueDot clients. This template is part of a series of infectious disease intelligence example templates created by BlueDot.   

This template consists of the following pages:
- [New, Notable, and Unusual Disease Activity Page](#new-notable-and-unusual-disease-activity-page)
- [Data Dictionary & Methods](#data-dictionary--methods-page)
 
### New, Notable, and Unusual Disease Activity page

This page consists of 3 main filters: 

1. The user can select the desired disease of interest. If the user does not select a disease, then all reports pertaining to any disease will be shown.  

2. The user selects the desired reporting period of the reports 

3. The user can search and select the desired location of which the reports were created for. This step is optional. If the user does not select a location, all reports reported globally in the time frame selected will be displayed.

The list of BlueDot reports can be further filtered by type. There are three categories of reports shown: breaking news, situational updates, and new activity. The topics covered by each of these report categories can be found in the [Data Dictionary and Methods page](#data-dictionary--methods-page).

The user can filter through reports based on the diseases reported in the location, the type of report, and adjust the timeframe as needed. Additionally, the ability to choose sublocation or multiple locations can be found at the top. If filters are not specified, all reports will be shown.  

Furthermore, the user can filter through reports based on the type of report shown breaking news, situational updates, and new activity. Additionally, users can sort through reports from Newest to Oldest, or Oldest to Newest.  

 ### Data Dictionary & Methods page

The Data Dictionary and Methods page can be found on the last tab of the template. Definitions for all terms and classifications of reports used in the template will be listed here. Additionally, methods for report discovery and classification will be found here.
