## Functionality

BlueDot’s Template 1: Disease in Location provides a detailed review of activities for the user selected infectious disease within a national and subnational location. This includes, subregional case and death intelligence (in-year and historical), year-over-year seasonal trends, regions experiencing increases or decreases of cases, disease characteristics (severity, preventability, and modes of transmission), and more. Users can view activities at a national level or go granular at a state/provincial level.
This template is a part of series of infectious disease intelligence PowerBI templates created by BlueDot.

This template consists of the following pages:
- [Disease and Location Search](#disease-and-location-search-page)
- [Disease Activity within a Nation](#disease-activity-within-a-nation-page)
- [Drill Down: Subnational Overview](#drill-down-page-subnational)
- [Disease Activity within a State/Province (Sub-nation)](#disease-activity-within-a-stateprovince-sub-nation)
- [Data Dictionary & Methods](#data-dictionary--methods-page)

### Disease and Location Search Page

This is the home page of the template, in which users can choose a disease and location of interest within a selected timeframe.
There are two options to view the disease activity:
- View National Location: Shows the disease data for one country of interest, with the option to see the same data at a subnational level for that country
- View Subnational Location: Shows the disease data for one state/province of interest

### Disease Activity within a Nation Page

This page gives an overview of the selected disease in the national location of interest. Disease intelligence statements outlining the case incidence (raw and per 100,000), the number of reported deaths (raw and per 100,000) during the selected time period are displayed at the top. Additionally, the trend in cases within 90 days of the last case report, compared to the same time period last year, is found under _YoY change in cases_. Disease intelligence surrounding case incidence and reported deaths, historically is displayed the two graphs shown below.

_Image 2: Disease data at a national level_

The Disease Profile section is located at the bottom of the National Overview Page. This section includes information on disease severity, preventability, and the modes of transmission of the disease of interest. The information displayed in this area changes based on the user’s selection of disease in the search page.

### Drill Down Page: Subnational

Users can see the disease data broken down by subnational administrative divisions of the selected country by clicking on the "See Profile at Subnational Level" option in the Disease Activity within a Nation page.

The subnational drill down page contains disease intelligence at a subnational level. Users can see trends at a subnational level, including which regions demonstrated the highest number of cases, the greatest increase, and decrease of cases from the most recent 90 days, compared to the same time period, last year. The map highlights regions reporting cases, with a table beneath to show the reported cases, deaths, and year-over-year trends in that region.
